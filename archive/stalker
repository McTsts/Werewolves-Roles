**Stalker** | Townsfolk Power | Archived
__Basics__
Each night, the Stalker may assign two extra votes to a player in the next day’s polls.
__Details__
Each night, the Stalker may threaten a player. The day after, that player has 2 more invisible votes against them on the daily polls. These additional votes are revealed when the polls close. The threatened player is privately notified of the threat and added to a channel.
Threatening a player is an immediate ability. The Stalker can anonymously talk to the person they’re threatening. At the end of the day the player is removed from the channel and the invisible votes are removed (even if the Stalker is dead at that point).
The Stalker may select themself. The Stalker is not affected by redirections.
