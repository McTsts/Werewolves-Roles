**Plaguebearer (Old)** | Solo Power - Graveyard Team | Archived 
__Basics__
The Plaguebearer (Old) is an alternative version of the vampire.
__Details__
Instead of demonizing, the Plaguebearer (Old) taints players. Instead of undead the Plaguebearer (Old) has zombies. A demonized player can't be tainted, and a tainted player can't be demonized. If tainting/demonizing fails the player is informed.
Members of the graveyard or underworld teams cannot be tainted or demonized.
