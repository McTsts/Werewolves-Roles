**Claimspace** | Town Miscellaneous | Archived
__Basics__
The Claimspace has no special abilities, and is only there for claimspace. 
__Details__
For each Claimspace in the game, an extra role is added to the role list along with Claimspace, however no player actually is this role. When the role list is sent, it is not noted which role is not actually in the game. 
The Claimspace is privately informed which role the extra was. If there are multiple Claimspaces, each Claimspace has their own extra role.
