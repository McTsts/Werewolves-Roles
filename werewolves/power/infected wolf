**Infected Wolf** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Infected Wolf must choose one player to convert to a Wolf.
__Details__
If the Infected Wolf fails to choose a player during Night 1, a random player will be selected for them. This ability can only be used once. 
Infecting a player is an immediate ability. Members of the Wolfpack canâ€™t be infected. 
If a Hell or Heaven team member is picked the power backfires and the Infected Wolf becomes a Imp or Saint respectively.
