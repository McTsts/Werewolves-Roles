**Tanner** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
Each day, the Tanner may disguise up to two players as roles of the Tanner’s choosing.
__Details__
Each day, the Tanner can weakly disguise two players; the night after, to roles affected by weak disguises, their roles will appear to be what the Tanner has disguised the players as. 
The Tanner may disguise themself. Disguising players is an immediate effect. 
If the tanner disguises a player who is part of the wolfpack, the tanner is informed by the Hosts that “At least one of the players you tanned today is part of the wolfpack”. 
If the Tanner dies, the assigned players will keep their disguises for the night. All players lose their disguise at the end of the night.
The Tanner is not a lycan, is not part of the wolfpack, and is not affected by strong disguises.
