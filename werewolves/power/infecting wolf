**Infecting Wolf** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Infecting Wolf must choose one player to convert to a wolf.
__Details__
If the Infecting Wolf fails to choose a player during Night 1, a random player will be selected for them. This ability can only be used once. 
Infecting a player is an immediate ability. Members of the wolfpack and werewolf team canâ€™t be infected, and attempting to do so will result in failure and waste the ability.
__Edge Cases__
If a hell team member is picked the power backfires and the Infecting Wolf becomes an imp.
If a baker or butcher is picked they become a bloody butcher.
If a cupid is picked they become a cupid wolf.
