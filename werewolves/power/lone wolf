**Lone Wolf** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
Each night, the Lone Wolf may attack one player. When the first member of the wolfpack dies, the Lone Wolf joins the wolfpack.
__Details__
The Lone Wolf doesn’t know the other werewolves, and starts off all alone, they are not a member of the wolfpack. 
Each night, they may kill one player on their own. If they kill someone who isn’t on the Townsfolk team or a Solo role, the Lone Wolf dies. 
When a member of the wolfpack dies, the Lone Wolf loses their powers and joins the wolfpack.
Killing a player is an end-night ability.
