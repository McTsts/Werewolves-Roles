**Infective Wolf** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Infective Wolf must choose one player to convert to a wolf.
__Details__
If the Infective Wolf fails to choose a player during Night 1, a random player will be selected for them. This ability can only be used once. 
Infecting a player is an immediate ability. Members of the wolfpack canâ€™t be infected. 
If a hell team member is picked the power backfires and the Infective Wolf becomes an imp.
