__Details__
Each night, the Warlock may inspect a player. They will be told what that player's role is. 
Inspecting a player is an immediate ability. The Warlock is affected by weak disguises and obstructions.
The Warlock is a werewolf version of the fortune teller, but they are not a lycan, nor are they a member of the wolfpack.
