**Pyromancer** | Solo Killing - Pyro Team
__Basics__
Each night, the Pyromancer may either powder one player or ignite all currently powdered players.
__Details__
Each night the Pyromancer may either powder or ignite all currently powdered people.
When a Pyromancer chooses to ignite, all powdered players will be attacked by them. If a powdered player survives the attack, they still remain powdered.
Powdering is an immediate ability, and igniting is an end-night ability. Instead of powdering the Pyromancer may also unpowder. 
The Pyromancer is a member of the pyro team and channel. 
The Pyros win when they're the last ones alive.
