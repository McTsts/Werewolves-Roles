**Flute Apprentice** | Solo Power - Flute Team
__Basics__
The Flute Apprentice is a Flute Player that canâ€™t enchant other players; instead, they can become the Flute Player if no Flute Players remain. Additionally, the Flute Apprentice can redirect the abilities of enchanted players.
__Details__
The Flute Apprentice may target a player, and update this target whenever they like. 
If any player that is enchanted uses an ability on the Flute Apprentice, the ability is instead redirected onto the Flute Apprentice's target. The original player is not informed about this.
If no Flute Players remain, the Flute Apprentice turns into a Flute Player and loses their redirection power.
