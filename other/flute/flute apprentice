**Flute Apprentice** | Solo Power - Flute Team
__Basics__
The Flute Apprentice is a Flute Player that canâ€™t enchant other players; instead, they can join the enchanted channel.
__Details__
Once, at any point during the game, the Flute Apprentice can join the enchanted channel. 
When the Flute Apprentice joins the enchanted channel it will seem like the Flute Apprentice was enchanted.
The Flute Apprentice may target a player, and update this target whenever they like. 
If any player that is enchanted uses an ability on the Flute Apprentice, the ability is instead redirected onto the Flute Apprentice's target. The original player is not informed about this.
