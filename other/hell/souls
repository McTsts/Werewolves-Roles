**Souls** | Additional Info - Hell Team
Members of the hell team that can use Souls (soul users) may use a Soul to protect someone from all attacks for the current night. If used during the day the player will be protected for the next night.
Using a Soul to protect a player is an immediate effect.

Soul users may use a Soul to attack a player. The player will be attacked immediately and it is not revealed why they died. 
This ability may be used during both day and night. If the attack fails it is explained.

If a soul user is attacked during the night and if they have a spare soul in the pool, they will be protected and a soul will be used up automatically. 
If they are attacked several times a soul is used for every attack. 
If several soul users are attacked at the same time and there aren't enough souls to protect them all, the protections are chosen randomly, but the Devil is always protected first.
When souls are used to protect a member the whole of hell is informed of who was attacked.
