**Souls** | Additional Info - Hell Team
Members of the hell team that can use Souls may use a Soul to protect someone else from all attacks for the current night. If used during the day the player will be protected for the next night.
Using a Soul to protect a player is an immediate effect.

Members of the hell team that can use Souls may use a Soul to kill a player. The player will be killed immediately and it is not revealed why they died. 
This ability may be used during both day and night.

If a member of the hell that that can use Souls is attacked during the night and if they have a spare soul in the pool, they will be protected and a soul will be used up automatically. 
If they are attacked several times a soul is used for every attack. 
If several members of the hell team are attacked at the same time and there aren't enough souls to protect them all, the protections are choosen randomly, but the Devil is always protected first.
