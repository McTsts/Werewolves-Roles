**Devil** | Solo Killing - Hell Team
__Basics__
Each day, the Devil may choose a player to send the devil’s wager to. 
The target may choose to either learn another player’s role, or attack another player, but sell their soul in the process. 
The Devil has a variety of uses for souls. 
When everyone is dead or soulless the Devil wins.
__Details__
The Devil can't target soulless players. The wager is sent at the end of the day. 
The Devil can anonymously communicate with the target & will be notified of the result of the wager - they will learn who was attacked/which person was inspected & what role the target saw. 

If the player chooses to see another player’s role (immediate), it will be affected by weak disguises and obstructions. These effects are seen from the player’s perspective, not the Devil’s.
If the player chooses to attack another player (soul sold: immediately; kill executed: end-night), then they will become soulless. The attacker is the Devil. 
If the player chooses to attack the Devil the attack will not be executed, but they will not be informed of this. However, they still sell their soul to the Devil.

The Devil can use a soul to protect someone else from all attacks for the next night (day; immediate) or kill a player of their liking (day/night; immediate). 
If the Devil is attacked at night and they have spare souls, they will be protected and a soul will be used up automatically. 

The Devil starts the game off with a single soul that they can use whenever.
At the start of the game, the Devil may choose a role as a weak disguise. If the Devil doesn’t choose a role, they will show up as a citizen.

The Devil starts out soulless.
Members of the Hell team cannot change role or betray the team in any way.
