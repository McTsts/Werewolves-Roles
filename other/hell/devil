**Devil** | Solo Killing - Hell Team
__Basics__
Each day, the Devil may choose a player to send the devil’s wager to. 
The devil's wager recipient may choose one of four options.
The Devil can use the hell team's pool of souls.
When everyone is dead or soulless the Devil wins.
__Details__
At the start of the game, the Devil may choose a role as a weak disguise. If the Devil doesn’t choose a role, they will show up as a citizen.

The Devil is soulless and their soul is in the hell team's pool of souls.
The Devil may use souls from the pool to protect or attack somebody. 
If the Devil is attacked while a soul is in the pool the soul will automatically be used to protect the Devil. (`$info souls` for a detailed explanation)

The Devil can't send the wager to soulless players. The wager is sent at the end of the day. 
The Devil can anonymously communicate with the target.
The recipient may choose to sell their soul to protect or attack somebody, or to share their identity to learn the role of another player. 
They may also ignore the wager. (`$info wager` for a detailed explanation)

Members of the Hell team cannot change role or betray the team in any way.



**Devil's Wager** | Additional Info - Hell Team
The Devil's Wager recipient may choose one of these four options:
1) The recipient may choose to sell their identity, to see another player’s role.
Checking another player is an immediate effect. Afterwards, the devil is privately informed what role the recipient has.
Both of the investigations are affected by weak disguises and obstructions. These effects are seen from the devil’s perspective, not the recipients’s.

2) The recipient may choose to sell their soul, to attack another player. 
Selling the soul immediately adds it to the pool. At the end of the night the devil will attack the player chosen by the recipient.
If the recipient chooses a member of the hell team, they will sell their soul as normal, but the devil will not execute the attack. The recipient is not informed.

3) The recipient may choose to sell their soul, to protect a player.
Selling the soul immediately adds it to the pool. For the rest of the night the player chosen by the recipient will be protected from any attacks to target them.
The recipient may choose to protect themself.

4) The recipient may choose to ignore the devil's wager. 

**Souls** | Additional Info - Hell Team
Members of the hell team that can use Souls may use a Soul to protect someone else from all attacks for the current night. If used during the day the player will be protected for the next night.
Using a Soul to protect a player is an immediate effect.

Members of the hell team that can use Souls may use a Soul to kill a player. The player will be killed immediately and it is not revealed why they died. 
This ability may be used during both day and night.

If a member of the hell that that can use Souls is attacked during the night and if they have a spare soul in the pool, they will be protected and a soul will be used up automatically. 
If they are attacked several times a soul is used for every attack. 
If several members of the hell team are attacked at the same time and there aren't enough souls to protect them all, the protections are choosen randomly, but the Devil is always protected first.
