**Devil's Wager** | Additional Info - Hell Team
The Devil's Wager recipient may choose one of these four options:
1) The recipient may choose to sell their soul, to attack another player. 
Selling the soul immediately adds it to the pool. At the end of the night the devil will attack the player chosen by the recipient.
If the recipient chooses a member of the hell team, they will sell their soul as normal, but the devil will not execute the attack. The recipient is not informed.

2) The recipient may choose to sell their soul, to protect a player.
Selling the soul immediately adds it to the pool. For the rest of the night the player chosen by the recipient will be protected from any attacks to target them.
The recipient may choose to protect themself.

3) The recipient may choose to sell their identity, to see another player’s role.
Checking another player is an immediate effect. Afterwards, the devil is privately informed what role the recipient has.
Both of the investigations are affected by weak disguises and obstructions. These effects are seen from the devil’s perspective, not the recipients’s.

4) The recipient may choose to ignore the devil's wager.
