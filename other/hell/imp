**Imp** | Solo Miscellaneous - Hell Team
__Basics__
The Imp wins with the devil and joins a channel with the devil to communicate securely.
__Details__
The Imp is usually the result of someone copying the devil for various reasons. This is because the devil is too powerful for there to be two. 
Their win condition is the same as the Devilâ€™s. The Imp starts out soulless.

Members of the Hell team cannot change role or betray the team in any way.
