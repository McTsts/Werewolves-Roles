**Gray Werewolf** | Solo Killing
__Basics__
The Gray Werewolf is a werewolf who is not satisfied with merely killing the townsfolk; they must kill all the werewolves as well. 
On even numbered nights, the Gray Werewolf may kill a member of the wolfpack.
__Details__
The Gray Werewolf is similar to the White Werewolf. A difference is that the Gray Werewolf can also win while one other player is alive. 
The Gray Werewolf wins when the only remaining players are the Gray Werewolf and optionally another player. 
Unlike the White Werewolf, the Gray Werewolf does not have a disguise. 
Killing a member of the wolfpack is an end effect. If only several werewolves and the Gray Werewolf are left alive, the game ends in a Werewolf victory.
The Gray Werewolf is considered a lycan.
