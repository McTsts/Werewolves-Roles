**White Werewolf** | Solo Killing 
__Basics__
The White Werewolf is a werewolf who is not satisfied with merely killing the townsfolk; they must kill all the werewolves as well. 
On even numbered nights, the White Werewolf may kill a member of the wolfpack.
__Details__
To the werewolves, the White Werewolf will appear to be a regular wolf. However, it is the White Werewolfâ€™s goal to win the game completely alone; even the other werewolves must die. 
Killing a member of the wolfpack is an end-night ability. 
If only werewolves and the White Werewolf are left alive, the game will continue until either all werewolves are dead or the White Werewolf is dead.
The White Werewolf is strongly disguised as a regular wolf. If the White Werewolf changes role, the disguise is lost.
The White Werewolf is considered a lycan.
