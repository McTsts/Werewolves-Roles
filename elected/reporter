**Reporter** | Elected
__Basics__
The Reporter is notified of the roles of the dead.
__Details__
The Reporter has access to a secret channel with the roles of the dead. The roles given are impervious to powers such as the flute player or tanner. 
The roles given are always the role that player was originally assigned; a dog who chooses to become a cursed civilian, then gets turned into a wolf and finally dies will be shown to the Reporter as 'dog'. 
The Reporter can be a powerful role to help either the innocent team or the werewolves team, but they tend to garner a lot of attention and may be killed quickly. 
The Reporter is elected on the first full day with a living Mayor and no living Reporter. 

__Simplified__
When there is a Mayor, a Reporter is elected. They will be able to see the starting roles of all players that have died.
