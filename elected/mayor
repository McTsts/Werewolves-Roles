**Mayor** | Elected
__Basics__
The Mayor leads the town. They have the privilege of being able to post in #story_time and receive an extra vote in polls. 
When there are more than 15 living players, instead of an extra vote the Mayor chooses each night whether the top one or the top two players being voted on will be lynched during the next day.
__Details__
The Mayor can be a powerful role to help either the innocent team or the werewolves team, but they tend to garner a lot of attention and may be killed quickly. 
If the Mayor misuses their ability to post in #story_time, they may be demoted or killed at the discretion of the Game Masters. 
If there is no mayor, the lynch vote always only kills the top voted player.
The Mayor's extra vote cannot be nullified, stolen or removed under any circumstances.
