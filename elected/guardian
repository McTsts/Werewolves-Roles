**Guardian** | Elected
__Basics__
The Guardian protects the town. When there are 15 or fewer players, the Guardian may choose one player. This player cannot be killed by attacks during the current night. When there are more than 15 they may choose up to two.
__Details__
The Guardian chooses their protected player(s) during the night, and they will be protected from attacks during the current night. 
They may not protect the same player two days in a row, but may protect themself and/or alternate between two or more players. 
Any attack against a player protected by the Guardian fails, however a protected player may still die through other means.
The Guardian is elected on the first full day with a living Mayor, a living Reporter and no living Guardian.
Protecing players from attacks is an immediate effect.
