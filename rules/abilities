**Basics**
There are several ways an ability can work. Some abilities are end-night/end-day, which means that they will be executed once the night/day ends. Other abilities are immediate. When a player uses an immediate ability it will be done as soon as possible by a Game Master (optimally it will be done immediately). 

**Delaying Abilities**
Delaying Immediate Abilities is not possible. One exception is that an immediate ability can be chosen one phase before it has to be executed (e.g. a Fortune Teller choosing a target during the day). If this is the case, the Game Masters will execute the immediate ability at an arbitrary time during its phase (the time can not be chosen).

**Immediate Abilities**
Immediate Abilities which are not investigative abilities can only be used once per phase, plus an emergency change once per game.
