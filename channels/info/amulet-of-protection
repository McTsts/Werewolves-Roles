ðŸ“¿ **Amulet of Protection** ðŸ“¿

You are the current holder of the *Amulet of Protection*. 
As long as you hold the amulet, you cannot die during the night, but you must pass it to another player during the day.
Whoever you pass it to, will not know who passed them the amulet. Each player may only hold the amulet once.
If you fail to find a player to pass the amulet to, it will shatter and you will die.
