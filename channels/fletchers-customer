🏹 **Fletcher's Customer** 🏹 

The Fletcher chose you to be “Fletcher’s Customer”. 

The Fletcher’s Customer may target a player, and update this target whenever they like. When the Fletcher’s Customer dies in any way other than by directly being lynched, their target will be attacked by them. The Fletcher’s Customer’s role is revealed to all, and the other player is attacked immediately. If the Fletcher’s Customer did not target a living player, the Fletcher’s Customer’s role isn’t revealed. 
At any point while the Fletcher is alive, the Fletcher may irreversibly revoke Fletcher’s Customer's abilities.
