These roles are usually not used in season games. They are generally reserved for Mini Wolves or Off-season games. This includes removed roles, upcoming/WIP roles, joke roles, and more.
Limited roles may not be used in games with closed or partial role lists. As they are generally not well tested they may require mid-game changes, which is not possible in those games.
