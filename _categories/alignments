Alignments are a big part of Werewolves Revamped. They decide your win condition (the way for you to win), and they decide who you can or can't cooperate with.
Each role has its base alignment listed next to the role name and generally this is the same as the player's actual alignment. When a role like Cupid is in play it's possible for the base alignment of players to differ from their actual alignment.
