'Unaligned Align - Cupid' are a subcategory of the unaligned align roles. The only Cupid that can exist at the start of the game is the plain Cupid. 
All Cupids can never change roles, except to another Cupid variant. Cupids have a base alignment, which is combined with the alignment of their lover to form their actual alignment.
