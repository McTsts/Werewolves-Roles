'Unaligned Align - Cupid' roles are a subcategory of the unaligned align roles. The only Cupid that can exist at the start of the game is the plain Cupid. Cupids are considered a part of the Unaligned Align category, but are listed separately to avoid confusion.
All Cupids can never change roles, except to another Cupid variant. Cupids have a base alignment, which is combined with the alignment of their lover to form their actual alignment.
