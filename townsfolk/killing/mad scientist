**Mad Scientist** | Townsfolk Killing
__Basics__
The Mad Scientist has two subjects, from two different teams. If killed, their targeted subject will also die.
__Details__
At the start of the game, the Mad Scientist is assigned two players. They interrogate their subjects and, before the Mad Scientist dies, they must choose one of the two assigned players to take with them to their death.
If the Mad Scientis has not targeted a subject when they die, a random subject will be killed.  
They will have a secret channel together with their two targets, and they also have a channel alone, where they will decide on who they want to attack if they are killed. 
The two targets are always on two different teams (excluding Unaligned). These teams are either Townsfolk, Werewolves or any of the different Solo teams.
The Mad Scientist can choose a target, even if the target is already dead. Attacking the other player is an immediate ability.
