**Priest** | Townsfolk Killing
__Basics__
Each night, the Priest may use his holy water on a player. If that player is a lycan, that player will be attacked. Otherwise, the Priest risks their own death.
__Details__
If the targeted player is a lycan, they are attacked. If they are townsfolk, the Priest dies. If they are not lycan and not townsfolk, both the Priest and the target live. 
Using holy water on a player is an end-night ability.
