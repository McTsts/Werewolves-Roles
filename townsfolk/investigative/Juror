**Juror** | Townsfolk Investigative/Group
__Basics__
The Jurors have a secret channel where they can communicate among themselves securely. On alternate days, the Jury votes to arraign and investigate a player.
If the Jury successfuly arraigns a non-town role, it is announced.
__Details__
The Juror is part of the Jury. After Day 0, on odd days, the cult can arraign a player, investigating them. 
The Jury recieves the result of the investigation at the end of the day. If the result of the investigation shows a non-town role, the role is immediately announced publicly.
The Jury is disbanded if there are 1 or more Jurors left; this means the Jury is active only if atleast two Jurors are alive. 
Any member of the Jury, even if they lose their role, can still vote on who to arraign. The Jury is affected by weak disguises and obstructions.
