**Hooker** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Each night, the Hooker sleeps with another player. They will not be killed by attacks on them, but will be affected by those taking place at their target’s house.
__Details__
Since the Hooker is at the other player’s house and not at home, any attacks in the night on them will fail; however, if the person they’re sleeping over at is being attacked, then so are they.
Choosing a player to sleep with is an immediate ability. From that point on, they will stay with that player for the rest of the night. The Hooker may also choose not to sleep with anybody.
