**Royal Knight** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Once per game, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch.
__Details__
The Royal Knight may cancel the lynch at any time of day or night, and it will apply to the next lynch. If there are several lynches the Royal Knight may only cancel one of them.
Cancelling the lynch is an immediate ability. However, the fact that the lynch has been canceled will only be revealed at the end of the day. 
The Royal Knight also receives the choice whether they want to be revealed or not. Cancelling the lynch results in nobody dying from the lynch that day.
