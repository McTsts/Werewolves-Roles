**Lover** | Unaligned Extra
__Basics__
A player becomes a Lover when they are chosen by a cupid, and forms an inseparable team with that cupid.
__Details__
During Night 1, each cupid must choose one player to become their Lover. The Lover is added to the cupid’s secret channel.
The Lover and their cupid form an inseparable team; they will die if the other player dies.
The Lover keeps their role and alignment, however it is combined with the cupid's alignment (usually townsfolk team). If the cupid and lover have different alignments, they will only win when both win conditions are fulfilled. For example, if the couple is cupid and the Lover is a wolf, everyone else must die. Or, if they’re both townsfolk, they belong to the townsfolk team and can win together with them. 
The Lover’s love overrides any other mechanic that may cause a player to change teams for any reason; the Lover is always on the same team as their cupid.
This is a role that is gained on top of your original role - it does not replace it.
