**Bitter Hag** | Solo Killing - Hag Team
__Basics__
If the hags have been wronged by all remaining teams, they turn into Bitter Hags. The Bitter Hag wins if all remaining players are dead, unaligned or hags. The Bitter Hag may use each of the hag spells once.
__Details__
When hags become Bitter Hags they gain a new secret channel with the other Bitter Hags (if there are any). Each Bitter Hag may protect, investigate and attack a player once. 
The Bitter Hag cannot be part of role lists and can only be created by a hag turning into it.
