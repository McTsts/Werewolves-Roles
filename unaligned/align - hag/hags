**The Hags** | Additional Information
The Hags win if they're alive at the end of the game, as long as the winning team didn't wrong them. At the start of the game, the Hags can win with any team, but if a team wrongs the Hags, the Hags can no longer win with them. The Hags do not know each other, but always have the same win condition and alignment. If the Hag are wronged it is announced which team has wronged the Hags, even if no Hags are left. If all remaining teams have wronged the Hags, all remaining Hags turn into bitter hags.
If a Hag is attacked, killed or has their role changed the team of the player responsible has wronged the Hags. If a Hag is lynched the team(s) which had the most votes on the lynched Hag has wronged the Hags. If a Hag is lynched by unusual means, the team of the player responsible has wronged the Hags. If a solo power role applies an effect to a Hag, they have wronged the Hags. Unaligned players cannot wrong the hags.
Each Hag can use one specific spell. Hags may only use their spell once, however every time a Hag is wronged they gain an additional use for their spell. Hags are allowed to wait until their spell has several uses and then use it more than once in one night.
Even when the Hags win condition is changed, they are still considered Unaligned (unless they turn into Bitter Hags).
