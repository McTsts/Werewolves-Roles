**Undead Cupid** | Solo Miscellaneous - Underworld Team
__Basics__
The Undead Cupid is a cupid that has been demonized and then killed.
__Details__
Instead of turning into an undead, the cupid turns into an Undead Cupid. 
The Undead Cupid works like the cupid, with one exception: The Undead Cupid's default win condition is to win with the underworld team.
If the lover is on a different team, they will only win when both win conditions are fulfilled. For example, if the couple is Cupid and a werewolf, everyone else must die. If the lover is also part of the underworld team, they belong to the underworld team and can win together with them. 
If the lover is unaligned, the couple can either win with the underworld team or with the lover's win condition.
