**Cupid** | Unaligned Align
__Basics__
The Cupid chooses one player to be their lover, and forms an inseparable team with that player.
__Details__
During Night 1, the Cupid must choose one player to become their lover. If the Cupid does not choose in time, they will fall in love with a random player. The lover is added to the Cupid’s secret channel.
The Cupid and their lover form an inseparable team; they will die if the other player dies. Choosing a lover is an immediate ability.
By default the Cupid wins with the townsfolk team. If the lover is on a different team, they will only win when both win conditions are fulfilled. For example, if the couple is Cupid and a werewolf, everyone else must die. Another example is when the couple is Undead and a Vampire, then the normal Vampire win condition must be reached. Or, if they’re both townsfolk, they belong to the townsfolk team and can win together with them. The Cupid’s love overrides any other mechanic that may cause a player to change teams for any reason; the Cupid is always on the same team as their lover. After choosing a lover, unless they are also unaligned, the Cupid is no longer unaligned.
