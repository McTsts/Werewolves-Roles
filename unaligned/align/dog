 **Dog** | Unaligned Align
__Basics__
During the first night, the Dog may choose between town crier, very cursed civilian or wolf, and will immediately become this role for the rest of the game.
__Details__
Choosing a role is an immediate ability. If the Dog hasnâ€™t chosen a role before the night ends, the dog will be given the role of the citizen. After using choosing a role the Dog is no longer unaligned.
