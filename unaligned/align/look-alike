**Look-Alike** | Unaligned Align
__Basics__
The Look-Alike copies the role of another player during Night 1.
__Details__
During Night 1, the Look-Alike must choose a player. All data, including whether they are enchanted or not, demonized, in love, etc, is copied. If the Look-Alike does not copy a player in time, a target will be randomly selected for them.
The Look-Alike may not copy themself. Choosing a player to copy is an immediate ability.
The target is not told they have been copied by the Look-Alike. This means that if the Look-Alike copies a wolf, they will join the wolf ranks, but the werewolves will not be told who has been copied; it could be that they copied the white werewolf, after all. After using their ability the Look-Alike is no longer unaligned.
