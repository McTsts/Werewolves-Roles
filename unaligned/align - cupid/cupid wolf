**Cupid Wolf** | Unaligned Align - Werewolf Base Alignment
__Basics__
The Cupid Wolf is a cupid that has been infected by the infected wolf.
__Details__
If turned into a wolf in any way, the cupid turns into an Cupid Wolf instead. 
The Cupid Wolf works like the cupid, with one exception: The Cupid Wolf's default win condition is to win with the werewolf team.
If the lover is on a different team, they will only win when both win conditions are fulfilled. For example, if the couple is Cupid and a citizen, everyone else must die. If the lover is also part of the werewolf team, they are werewolf aligned and can win together with them. 
If the lover is unaligned, the couple can either win with the werewolf team or with the lover's win condition.
