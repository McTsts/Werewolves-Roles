**Amulet Holder** | Townsfolk Power | Limited
__Actions:__
At the start of the game, the Amulet Holder is the first holder of the *Amulet of Protection*. Whoever holds the amulet is protected from attacks during the night, but must pass it to another player during the day.
__Basics:__
Selecting a player to pass the amulet to is an immediate day effect, but passing it is an end day effect. The amulet cannot be passed to someone who has previously held it and attempting to do so will result in a failure and requires the holder to select a new target. The holder of the amulet cannot die under any circumstances during the night, but may die during the day. Should that happen, the amulet is lost.
Holders of the amulet do not know who gave them the amulet, nor do they know who has previously held it.
If the holder of the amulet does not or can not choose a player to pass the amulet to, it shatters at the end of the day, killing the holder.
Once the Amulet Holder passes the amulet, they do not have any powers anymore, but their role remains as Amulet Holder; other holders of the amulet keep their role and do not change into an Amulet Holder.
The Amulet Holder must pass the amulet during Day 0.

__Simplified:__
At the start of the game, the Amulet Holder is the first holder of the *Amulet of Protection*. Whoever holds the amulet is protected from attacks during the night, but must pass it to another player on the following day. Each player can only hold the amulet once, and if no players remain that may hold the amulet, it shatters, killing the current holder.
