**Shiny Wolf** | Werewolf Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Shiny Wolf redirects all non-killing powers back to the source of that power.
__Details__
When the Shiny wolf is affected by a power, that is not an attack, it will be redirected back to the source of that power.
The Shiny Wolf not be informed when this happens, nor will the source of that power. Killing powers like priest's water will not be redirected.
Powers with multiple targets will only redirect a single target back to the source. Powers that could not normally target themselves will still be redirected.
