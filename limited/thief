**Thief** | Unaligned Align | Limited
__Basics__ 
Each night, the Thief chooses one player to switch roles with. 
__Details__
When they switch with a player, they become that player's role, and the other player becomes the Thief. Role specific disguises are also switched.
Selecting a player to switch with is an immediate effect, but switching roles is an end night action and happens after any other end night actions such as night kills. The Thief can switch with a dead player, if the player was alive when they selected them. 
When switching with another player, all their channels are switched. Effects such as being powdered are not swapped. 
If the Thief does not select a target, a random player is chosen. Each Thief may only select every player once. 
The Thief wins if they are still alive at the end of the game or alternatively if there's no or only Unaligned players left to select, the Thief immediately ascends and wins. This can happen immediately after selecting a player.
The Thief's ability is more powerful than any other mechanic. If a Thief switches with a member of Hell, the current member of Hell betrays their team and becomes a Thief. If the Thief switches with a member of a cupid couple, that member betrays the couple to become a thief and the former thief joins the couple instead.
