**Thief** | Unaligned Miscellaneous
__Basics__ 
Each night, the Thief choose a player to switch roles with. 
__Details__
The Thief wins if they are still alive at the end of the game. 
When they switch with a player, they become that player's role, and the other player becomes the Thief. 
Selecting a player to switch with is an immediate effect, but switching roles is an end night action and happens after any other end night actions such as night kills. The Thief can switch with a dead player, if the player was alive when they selected them. 
When switching with another player, all their channels are switched. Effects such as being powdered are not swapped. 
If the Thief does not select a target, a random player is chosen. Each Thief may only select every player once. 
If there's no or only Unaligned players left to select, the Thief immediately ascends and wins. This can happen immediately after selecting a player.
