**Bat** | Solo Power - Underworld Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Bat haunts one other player. The Bat will not be affected by attacks targetting them, but will instead be affected by those taking place at their target’s house. Any player that interacts with the Bat's target while the Bat is visiting becomes demonized.
__Details__
Since the Bat is at the other player’s house and not at home, any attacks targeting the Bat in the night will fail; however, if the person they’re haunting is being attacked, then they both are attacked. Choosing a player to haunt is an immediate ability. From that point on, they will stay with that player for the rest of the night. The Bat may also choose not to haunt anybody. Any player that interacts with the Bat's target in any way while the Bat is visiting will become demonized immediately.
The Bat may not haunt the same player twice and can only haunt demonized players or members of the underworld team.
If the Bat is haunting another player while being protected from attacks, the protection is ignored; only protections for the player they are haunting apply.
The Bat is part of the Underworld team and wins with the vampire. The Bat is demonized from the start of the game and can turn into an undead.
