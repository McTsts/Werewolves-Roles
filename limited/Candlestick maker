**Candlestick Maker** | Townsfolk Group | Limited
__Basics__
The Candlestick Maker don’t start with more than one player in their group however each night they can add a player to their group
__Details__
Candlestick Makers are a special type of townsfolk group, they don’t start  with multiple people in their group however each night the Candlestick Maker has a poll on who to add to their channel to form a group, these players are not guaranteed to be town so therefore the Candlestick Maker must be careful on who they add.
Alternatively if the group vote for a person already in the group they will kick that player out of the secret channel, the Candlestick Maker cannot be kicked out of their own secret channel and therefore cannot be voted on the poll
The Candlestick Maker group is disbanded when the Candlestick maker dies and no more people can be added to the group.
