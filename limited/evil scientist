**Evil Scientist** | Solo Killing - Disease Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Evil Scientist has invented a new disease, lethal and highly contagious. Their desire is to
kill off all players.
__Details__
They starts off with two (or three for larger games) vials of a substrate containing the
disease. At any night, they may use one vial to infect another player. Infected players will
be affected by the disease.
If the Evil Scientist attempts to infect an already infected player, they are informed, but the vial is used up.
Infecting a player is an immediate ability.
__The Disease__
N0 - Player is infected [Night Immediate]
D1 - Player becomes contagious, and remains so till their death. Any player (except the
Evil Scientist) who visits or is visited by a contagious player gets infected
(group visits, such as werewolf kills counts as a visit, but only one random person who voted for the
contagious player is infected) [End-Day]
N1 - Player is still contagious
D2 - Player is informed of infection [End-Day]
N2 - Player dies (no possible way to survive), cause of death is announced publicly [End-Night]
