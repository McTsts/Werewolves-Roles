**Frankenstein's Monster** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Whenever a town power role dies, you gain their night power the next night.
__Details__
Frankenstein's Monster starts with no powers. Whenever a town player dies that had a night ability, Frankenstein's Monster gains that ability the next night.
If a role with limited uses of their power dies, Frankenstein's Monster will only receive a power if it's unused.
For example, if a witch dies that has already used their potion of death, Frankenstein's Monster will only receive the potion of life.
In the case of multiple deaths at once, Frankenstein's Monster will not be told from who they got their powers, but will receive all powers the next night.
The gained abilities can only be used the next night, and are lost after that.
