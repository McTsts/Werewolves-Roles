__Details__
Each night, the ? Wolf may check a player to find out how much of a threat they are to the pack.
The ? Wolf checks the category of their target's role, and receives an answer based on that.
For categories of other alignments, investigative and killing roles are considered a major threat; power, recruitment and group roles a significant threat; and miscellaneous roles a slight threat.
Werewolf Killing roles are also a slight threat and all remaining werewolf categories, as well as all unaligned categories are not a threat.
The ? Wolfâ€™s check is an immediate ability. The ? Wolf is affected by strong disguises and redirections, but not by weak disguises or obstructions.
