**Spirit** | Solo Miscellaneous - Nightmare Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Spirit is a part of the reaperâ€™s secret army and pretends to be their old role. When the reaper uses a recruitment power on a player, they become a Spirit.
__Details__
The Spirit has the same win condition as the reaper; they will win when all remaining players are part of the nightmare team.
They lose their previous role, but if they were part of a group like the wolfpack, they will remain in the channel and will still be able to vote (though internally their vote won't be counted) as long as at least one other member of their group is still alive. 
Once all members have either been turned or are dead, the group is disbanded and any abilities it may have had are lost.

__Simplified__
The Spirit is a part of the reaper's team. If the reaper uses a recruitment power on a player, they become a Spirit, losing their previous role.
