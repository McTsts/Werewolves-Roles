**Royal Wolf** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
Once per game, the Royal Wolf may cancel the election.
__Details__
The Royal Wolf may cancel the election at any time of day or night, and it will apply to the next election. If there are several elections the Royal Wolf may only cancel one of them.
Cancelling the election is an immediate ability. However, the fact that the election has been canceled will only be revealed at the end of the day. 
The Royal Wolf also receives the choice whether they want to be revealed or not. Cancelling the election results in nobody getting elected from the election that day.
