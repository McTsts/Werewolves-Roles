**Zombie** | Solo Recruitment - Graveyard Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Zombie may bite another player. If a player is bitten a second time they become a Zombie.
__Details__
When a Zombie bites a player a second time, they immediately become a Zombie. The bitten player betrays their team and joins the graveyard channel. They can also immediately bite another player. If they previously were part of another group, they remain in it, but lose their vote. If all members of a certain group have been turned or are dead, their ability will be lost and the group is disbanded.
If a Zombie dies, every other Zombie that has been turned by the dying Zombie also dies. 
The Zombies win when all players are either dead or part of the graveyard team.
