**Reaper** | Solo Power - Nightmare Team
__Basics__
The Reaper may use the powers of dead players, temporarily. When the Reaper uses a power on a player they turn sleepless. 
The Reaper wins when all living players have been turned sleepless.
__Details__
The Reaper knows the roles of all dead players. At night the Reaper will be able to use the power of every player that has died since the start of the previous night.
If a role with limited uses of their power dies, the Reaper will only receive a power if it has uses left.
For example, if a witch dies that has already used their potion of death, the Reaper will only receive the potion of life.
The gained abilities can only be used during this night, and are lost after that.

The Reaper is able to use passive powers. They are also able to use powers involving a reveal, however nobody will be revealed.
If the Reaper uses a power on another player (e.g. targeting or investigation) the targeted player turns sleepless. 
Any immediate day or end day abilities turn into immediate night and end night abilities.
Abilities that usually apply effects (e.g. enchanting, powdering) instead just turn the player sleepless.
If an ability results in a role change (e.g. Look-Alike, Infected Wolf), no role change happens, instead a weak disguise of the role that the player would have turned into is applied to the player. The Reaper is informed which disguise is being used.
All abilities involving anonymous communication (e.g. Devil, Stalker) happen without the communication taking place or the targeted player being aware, for those abilities where another player needs to make a choice (e.g. Devil's Wager), the Reaper may choose for the targeted player.

Players are privately informed when they become sleepless. When a sleepless player uses a power on the Reaper, their power fails and they die.
