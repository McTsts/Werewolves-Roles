**Reaper** | Solo Power - Nightmare Team
__Basics__
The Reaper may use the powers of dead players, temporarily. When the Reaper uses a power on a player they turn sleepless. 
The Reaper wins when all living players have been turned sleepless.
__Details__
The Reaper knows the roles of all dead players. At night the Reaper will be able to use the power of every player that has died since the start of the previous night.
If a role with limited uses of their power dies, the Reaper will only receive a power if it has uses left. However, emergency changes are always unavailable.
For example, if a witch dies that has already used their potion of death, the Reaper will only receive the potion of life.
Other limitations, like only being able to select every player once or only being able to select specific players still apply, but the Reaper is not informed which player can't be selected. If they select an invalid player, they are informed that their power failed.
The gained abilities can only be used during this night, and are lost after that.
If one of the dead players had a disguise, their disguise is applied to the Reaper as a weak disguise for the night.
If the Reaper uses a power on another player the targeted player turns sleepless. 

Players are privately informed when they become sleepless. 
When a sleepless player uses a power on the Reaper, their power fails and they die.
