**Coward** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Coward may select a player to redirect one wolf action to. 
__Details__
The Coward may target a player. They can update this target once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Coward wants. 
When the Coward is affected by any wolf power, it will be redirected to the target without the wolves being informed. 
The Coward cannot redirect a wolf power onto a wolf in the pack, and if the Coward tries to, then the redirection will silently fail. 
The Coward's redirection power can only be used once per game.
