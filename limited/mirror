**Mirror** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Mirror redirects all non-killing powers back to the source of that power.
__Details__
When the Mirror is affected by a power, that is not an attack, it will be redirected back to the source of that power.
The Mirror not be informed when this happens, nor will the source of that power. Killing powers like wolf attacks will not be redirected.
Powers with multiple targets will only redirect a single target back to the source. Powers that could not normally target themselves will still be redirected.
