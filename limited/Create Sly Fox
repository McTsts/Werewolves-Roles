**Sly Fox** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
Each day the sly fox may choose a player and hide in their house, protecting them from any kill targeted at them but not the house they are hidden in, the wolfpack is informed at the start of day if anyone tried to kill the sly fox that night. Once per game, the Sly Fox may alternatively join the wolfpack as a regular wolf. 
__Details__
Each day the Sly Fox may ever hide in someone's house that night or choose to join the wolfpack. 
When the Sly Fox hides in someone's house they will be immune to any attack targeting them but will be killed if the person they hide behind is killed, except if their target is attacked by a wolf then the sly fox will turn into a wolf. 
If someone attempts to attack the Sly Fox at night while it is hidden at someone’s house then the wolfpack is told that the Sly Fox’s house was visited by a killer. 
The Sly Fox and wolfpack do not know each other's identities, as the Sly Fox is not a lycan, nor a member of the wolfpack. 
If the Sly Fox chooses to join the wolfpack, they may not hide that day, and will lose their power as they will become a regular wolf. 
Joining the wolfpack is an immediate ability and hiding is an end effect.
