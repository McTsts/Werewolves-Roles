**Lab Assistant** | Solo Miscellaneous - Plague Team | Limited
__Basics__ 
The Lab Assistant wins with the plaguebearers and joins a channel with them to communicate securely.
__Details__
The Lab Assistant does not have any special abilities. If somebody tries to copy a plaguebearer a Lab Assistant is created instead. 
The Lab Assistant can be a carrier of the plague but once they become contaminated they don't die and instead stay contagious for the rest of the game.
The plaguebearer may not directly contaminate the Lab Assistant using one of their rodents.
