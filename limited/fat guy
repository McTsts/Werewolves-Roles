**Fat Guy** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The night after the Fat Guy dies, the wolfpack will receive an additional kill.
__Details__
Whenever the Fat Guy dies, the wolfpack will receive an additional kill the next night. If more than one Fat Guy dies, the additional kills are cumulative.
The same target can be attacked more than once. This is useful to take out Runner or Macho in one night.
If Riding Hood is preventing the wolfpack kill, it will also prevent additional kills.
