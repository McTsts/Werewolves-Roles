**Fat Guy** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The night after the Fat Guy dies, the wolf pack will receive an additional kill.

Whenever the Fat Guy dies, the wolf pack will receive an additional kill the next night. If more than one Fat Guy dies, the additional kills are cumulative.
If Riding Hood is preventing the wolf pack kill, it will also prevent additional kills.
