**Tasty Villager** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
The night after the Tasty Villager dies, the wolfpack will receive an additional kill.
__Details__
Whenever the Tasty Villager dies, the wolfpack will receive an additional kill the next night. If more than one Tasty Villager dies, the additional kills are cumulative.
The same target can be attacked more than once. This is useful to take out a Runner in one night.
If Riding Hood is preventing the wolfpack kill, it will also prevent additional kills.
