**Acrobat** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
Twice per game, if attacked by a werewolf team member, the Acrobat shall escape.
__Details__
When they are attacked, the Acrobat will not die, but after the second attack they will be vulnerable to future attacks. 
Acrobats are informed that they were attacked. If an Acrobat evades the wolfpack, the wolfpack is told why.
If an Acrobat is targeted by any attack other than a werewolf attack, they will die the first time.
