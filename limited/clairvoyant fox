**Clairvoyant Fox** | Werewolf Investigative
__Basics__
Each day, the Clairvoyant Fox may investigate a player, and the results will be known to both them and the Wolfpack. Once per game, the Clairvoyant Fox may alternatively join the wolfpack as a regular wolf.
__Details__
Each day, the Clairvoyant Fox may either investigate a player or choose to join the wolfpack. 
When the Clairvoyant Fox investigates a player they see that player's role. The investigation is affected by weak disguises and obstructions.
If the Clairvoyant Fox survives the day, the result of the investigation is announced to them as well as to the wolfpack at the start of the night. The wolfpack only sees the result and that it's from a Clairvoyant Fox - they don't know who was checked.
The Clairvoyant Fox and wolfpack do not know each other's identities, as the Clairvoyant Fox is not a lycan, nor a member of the wolfpack. 
If the Clairvoyant Fox chooses to join the wolfpack, they may not investigate that day, and will lose their power as they will become a regular wolf. 
Joining the wolfpack is an immediate ability and investigating a player is an end effect.
