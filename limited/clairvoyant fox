**Clairvoyant Fox** | Werewolf Investigative
__Basics__
Each day, the Clairvoyant Fox may investigate a player, and the results will be known to both the Clairvoyant Fox and the Wolfpack. Once per game, the Clairvoyant Fox may alternatively join the wolfpack as a regular wolf.
__Details__
Each day, the Clairvoyant Fox may either investigate a player or choose to join the wolfpack.
If the Clairvoyant Fox survives the day, the results of the investigation are announced to the wolfpack at the start of the night.
The Clairvoyant Fox and wolfpack do not know each other's identities, as the Clairvoyant Fox is not a lycan, nor a member of the wolfpack. 
If the Clairvoyant Fox chooses to join the wolfpack, they may not investigate that day, and will lose their power as they will become a regular wolf. 
Joining the wolfpack is an immediate ability. The Clairvoyant Fox is affected by strong disguises and obstructions.
The Clairvoyant Fox may not investigate themself.
