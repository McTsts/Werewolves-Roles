**Survivor** | Unaligned Miscallaneous 
__Basics__
The Survivor needs to stay alive until the end of the game, but can steal the win from the Townsfolk and Werewolves.
__Details__
At the start of the game, the Survivor may choose a role as a strong disguise. If the Survivor doesnâ€™t choose a role, they will show up as a citizen.
The Survivor wins the game by staying alive until the end. However, they will steal the win from the Townsfolk and Werewolves.
For example, if the werewolves succesfully eliminate all solo and town roles, if the survivor is still alive, they will steal the victory, making them the sole winner (along with other unaligned).
The Survivor will not steal the win from any solo teams.
