**Ice King** | Solo Power - Ice Royals | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Ice King can submit a list of players. Every player the Ice King guesses correctly will be frozen and will have their public votes nulled.
__Details__
Each night, the Ice King can submit a list of players. The amount of guesses is limited by the amount of players at the start of the game. For every 5 players (rounded), the Ice King gets 1 guess. If they have submitted all their guesses, all the players that the Ice King guessed correctly will be frozen. Frozen players are not notified about this, but their votes will no longer count in the public votes. One exception is the mayor - the second mayor vote is still counted. 
Guessing roles and freezing players is an immediate ability, and the Ice King is informed which guesses were right. The Ice King may use several of their guesses on one player. The Ice King's guesses are not affected by disguises, obstructions or redirections. 
Frozen players are obstructed; if they have an investigative power and are affected by obstructions, they will see the Ice King as a role the Ice King chooses at the start of the game. 
The Ice King is an ice royal, knows the other ice royals and works together with them. The ice royals win when all players, except the ice royals, are frozen or dead.
When the last member of the ice royal team or channel dies, all frozen players will be unfrozen and their vote(s) will count again.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Ice King may guess a certain amount of players' role. Correctly guessed players will be frozen, removing their public votes.
Frozen players are obstructed, and if affected, can't see the Ice King's true role.
The Ice King wins when everyone is dead, unaligned, an ice royal or frozen.
