**Tracker Wolf** | Werewolf Investigative | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Tracker Wolf may find out how much of a threat a player is to the pack.
__Details__
Each night, the Tracker Wolf may check the category of a player's role to find out how much of a threat they are to the pack. The Tracker Wolf only learns how much of a threat the player is and not the role's category.
For townsfolk and solo categories, investigative and killing roles are considered a major threat; power, recruitment and group roles a significant threat; and miscellaneous roles a slight threat.
Werewolf killing roles are considered a slight threat. All other werewolf roles, as well as all unaligned roles, are not considered a threat.
The Tracker Wolfâ€™s check is an immediate ability. The Tracker Wolf is affected by strong disguises and redirections, but not by obstructions.
