**Plague Doctor** | Unaligned Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
The Plague Doctor is mostly immune to the plague bearerâ€™s disease and requires the plague team to be eliminated in order to win. They may check if players have the plague.
__Details__
As soon as the plague team is eliminated, the Plague Doctor ascends and wins.
Each night, the Plague Doctor may check a player to see if they have the plague and, if they do, since when they have it. This is an immediate ability.
If the plague bearer attempts to contaminate the Plague Doctor with one of their rodents, the Plague Doctor dies (unavoidable).
Otherwise, the Plague Doctor is immune to the disease.
