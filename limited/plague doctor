**Plague Doctor** | Unaligned Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
The Plague Doctor is mostly immune to the plague bearerâ€™s disease and requires the plague team to be eliminated in order to win. Each night, they may check a player for symptoms of the plague.
__Details__
As soon as the plague team is eliminated, the Plague Doctor ascends and wins.
Each night, the Plague Doctor may check a player for symptoms of the plague. The Plague Doctor will immediately be informed if and since when their target has had the plague.
Members of the plague team do not have any symptoms and will *never* show up as having the plague.
If the plague bearer attempts to contaminate the Plague Doctor with one of their rodents, the Plague Doctor dies (unavoidable).
Otherwise, the Plague Doctor is immune to the disease.
