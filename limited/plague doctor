**Plague Doctor** | Unaligned Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
The Plague Doctor is immune to the plague bearerâ€™s disease and requires the plague bearer to be dead in order to win. They may check if players have the plague.
__Details__
As soon as the plague bearer dies, the Plague Doctor ascends and wins.
Each night, the Plague Doctor may check a player to see if they have the plague and, if they do, since when they have it. This is an immediate ability.
If the plague bearer attempts to contaminate the Plague Doctor, it fails and the rodent is used up.
Both the plague bearer and the Plague Doctor are informed of the failure, however.
The Plague Doctor must vote in every lynch poll. If they miss one, they will die immediately.
