**Exorcist** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Each night, the Exorcist may remove negative effects from one player.
__Details__
Each night, the Exorcist can exorcise one player. All negative effects caused by solo roles are removed from the player and the Exorcist is informed which effects were removed. 
Players that have already been exorcised can not be exorcised again. The Exorcist can not cure players if they have changed role as the result of an effect, such as the Undead. 
The solo team who's effect is cured is informed about this.
