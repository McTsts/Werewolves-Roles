**Cat** | Unaligned Align | Limited
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Cat will immediately become the opposite role Dog choses for the rest of the game. 
__Details__
If the Dog chooses town crier, the Cat will turn into wolf; cursed civilian will turn Cat into psychopath with the dog in the list; and wolf will turn the Cat into a town crier.
Changing role is an immediate consequence of the dog choosing. If the dog hasnâ€™t chosen a role before the night ends or there is no dog in the game, the Cat will be given the role of Survivor. 
The Cat can't be in the same game with more than one dog.
