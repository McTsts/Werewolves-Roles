**Poisoner** | Werewolf Power | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Poisoner may poison a player, weakening them.
__Details__
Each night, the Poisoner may poison a player. Poisoning a player is an immediate ability. The player is informed they are poisoned.
The following night, the poison will disable passive protection abilities. This makes roles like Macho susceptible to night kills.
The Poisoner is not a lycan, nor are they a member of the wolfpack.
