**Corrupt Wolf** | Werewolf Power | Limited
__Basics__
The Corrupt Wolf can steal a player's votes in the next day's public polls.
__Deatils__
Each night, the Corrupt Wolf may select a player and a number of votes (2 or -1). The next day, the selected player has the chosen vote value instead of their usual value. 
The number of votes replaces the player's vote, it is not additive, with the exception of the Mayor who still gains an extra vote.
Stealing a vote is immediate.
The Corrupt Wolf may also communicate with their chosen player in a whispers channel during the day.
