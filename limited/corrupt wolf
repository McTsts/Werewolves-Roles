**Corrupt Wolf** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
Once per game, the Corrupt Wolf may cancel the election.
__Details__
The Corrupt Wolf may cancel the election at any time of day or night, and it will apply to the current (or if there is none the next) election. If there are several elections the Corrupt Wolf may only cancel one of them.
Cancelling the election is an immediate ability. However, the fact that the election has been canceled will only be revealed at the end of the day. 
Cancelling the election results in nobody getting elected from the election that day.
