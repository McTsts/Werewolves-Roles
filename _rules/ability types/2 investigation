**Investigation**
Investigations are a type of ability that aims to gather more information about the game. Through various other abilities (See Disguises/Obstructions/Redirections) investigations are not always guaranteed to return an accurate result. The most generic type of investigation is to see another player's role (e.g. Fortune Teller), however many other types of investigation exist (e.g. Oracle). Investigations usually, but not always, happen immediately.
