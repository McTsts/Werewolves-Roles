**Targetting**
Targetting is a type of ability that on its own does not do much. Targetting is usually used by roles that cannot decide when their primary ability triggers, so in advance they may select a player (or other type of target) that should be targetted by their ability once it does trigger. Examples of this are the Huntress, who attacks a targetted player on death, or the Executioner who lynches a targetted player if lynched. Targetting is generally immediate and is limited to one use per phase, with one emergency use the player may use at any point in the game.
