**Attacks**
Attacks are a type of ability that aims to kill another player, however success of this isn't guaranteed (See Blocks/Protections), making it different from killing. Some of the most generic attacks are the Assassin and the Wolfpack. Attacks usually, but not always, happen at the end of a phase.
