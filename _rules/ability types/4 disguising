**Disguising*
Disguising is a type of abilities that aids in hiding from Investigation abilities. There are strong and weak disguises. Some roles have a disguise they can not alter (White Werewolf, Devil), others can even disguise other people (Tanner).
Disguises are explained in detail in the Disguises section.
