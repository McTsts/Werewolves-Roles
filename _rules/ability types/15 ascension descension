**Ascension & Descension**
Unaligned players may leave the game early with either a win (ascension) or a loss (descension). This happens when they complete their win condition, or when winning becomes impossible for them. When players ascend or descend it will be treated as if they died, and their ascension/descension, as well as their role will be announced.
