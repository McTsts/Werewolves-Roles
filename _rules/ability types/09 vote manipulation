**Vote Manipulation**
Vote Manipulation is a group of abilities that affect voting in some way. There is three types of way this can happen. Public voting power manipulation affects the voting power of someone on public polls (e.g. Grandma (active), Trickster (passive)), private voting power manipulation affects the voting power on private polls (e.g. Alpha Wolf (passive)) and public vote manipulation affects how many votes a certain player has on public votes on top of the normal amount of votes they receive (e.g. Stalker (active), Angel (passive))
