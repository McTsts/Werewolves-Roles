**Solo*
Solo is a group of various smaller alignments. The solos make up about 10% of the players. Most of the time, they either work completely alone or in a very small team. Their goal is to win by outplaying everyone who doesn't have the same win condition as them. There can be several separate solo alignments in one game and under some circumstances, new ones can be created during the game.
