**Unaligned**
The unaligned are truly unique. They make up about 10% of the players. Their goal is to fulfill their win condition. With that, they might even change alignment. 
The ones that don't change alignment ascend when they win, leaving the game dead, but with a win in their pocket. As they have no alignment, they are free to work with whatever alignment they want.
