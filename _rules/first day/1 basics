**Basics**
'First Day' refers to ’Day 1’. Sometimes a game starts with ’Day 0’; despite this, ’Day 1’ is still considered to be the first day. Similarly, 'First Night' refers to ’Night 1’ and never ’Night 0’ (which is not usually used). This is relevant for roles that cannot or have to use their powers during the first day/night.
