**Delaying Abilities**
Delaying Immediate Abilities is possible in only one ways:
An immediate ability can be chosen one phase before it has to be executed (e.g. a Fortune Teller choosing a target during the day). If this is the case, the Game Masters will execute the immediate ability at an arbitrary time during its phase (the time can not be chosen).
This delaying can be cancelled if it is done before the ability is executed.
