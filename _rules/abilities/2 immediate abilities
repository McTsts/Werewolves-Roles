**Immediate Abilities**
Most Immediate Abilities can only be used once per phase. Additionally, abilities like targetting usually have an emergency change once per game.
Some targeting abilities (e.g. Executioner) can still be used even if the main power (e.g. lynching another player) has already be used.
