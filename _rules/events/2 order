End Day Effects - End day effects (Devil's Wager, Chef's Poison) happen - if the player doing them is still alive.
End Day Effect Consequences - Consequences of the end day effects happen (e.g. somebody being poisoned).

__Night__
Immediate Night Effects - Effects that happen immediately during the game. For example most investigations.

End Night Effects - End night effects happen. E.g. the wolfpack's kill. If a player is alive during this stage and executes an effect, the effect happens even if they die as a consequence of an end night effect.
End Night Effects Consequences - Consequences of the end night effects happen (e.g. somebody being attacked).
Start Day Effects - Start day effects happen after end night effects and their consequences have been fully completed - if the player doing them is still alive. 

__Conflicts__
If several abilities happen at the same time the following rules are applied. Non-attacks happen before attacks. Attacks are ordered according to the attack order rules.
Non-attack abilities are prioritized according to alphabetical sorting. If a conflict still exists a random player is chosen to be prioritized.
