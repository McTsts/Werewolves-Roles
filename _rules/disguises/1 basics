**Basics**
There are several ways to obtain disguises, which mask what role an investigative role (other types of roles are generally not affected) sees a player as when inspecting them. Permanent disguises are either active from the start, or have to be selected once, and are always applied below all other disguises. Non-permanent disguises are applied on top of all current disguises. Only the topmost disguise is relevant for investigative roles.
