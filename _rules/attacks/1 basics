**Basics**
Many roles or groups can attack. Attacks generally result in the attacked player dying, unless their role explicitly says otherwise. The player attacking another player is known as “Attacker”.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, an attack is considered successful if the player ends up dead as a result of the attack and unsuccessful if the player survives.
