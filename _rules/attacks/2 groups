**Groups**
When a group (such as Cult or Werewolves) attacks a player, a random member of the group (who voted for the target) is chosen as the attacker. The group is informed who is chosen. Unless explicitly listed otherwise, this attacker is always considered as the sole cause of the attack, and never the group.
